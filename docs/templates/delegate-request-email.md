# Delegate request email (copy/paste)

Subject: SciENcv delegate access for NIH Common Forms

Hi [Name],

NIH is requiring SciENcv Common Forms (Biosketch + Current & Pending Support) for submissions on/after Jan 25, 2026.  
I’ve added you as a **MyNCBI delegate** so you can help prepare my SciENcv documents.

Please confirm once you can see my delegated profile in SciENcv and let me know what you need from me (products list, narratives, etc.).

Thanks,  
[PI Name]
