# Complete walkthrough (Biosketch + CPOS)

This page consolidates the end-to-end steps (PI + admin) for both documents.

## 0) Prep (do once per person)

- Confirm **eRA Commons ID**
- Create **ORCID iD**
- Link ORCID in **eRA Commons** *and* **MyNCBI**
- Clean **My Bibliography** (publications + non-traditional products)
- Add **delegate** (optional)

## 1) Create the NIH Biosketch in SciENcv

1. MyNCBI → SciENcv → Create New Document
2. Format: NIH Biosketch (Common Form + Supplement)
3. Choose a starting point:
   - ORCID import (fast)
   - Copy from existing SciENcv doc (if you had one)
   - Blank (manual)

### Fill the Common Form

- Identifying information (ensure ORCID appears as PID)
- Professional Preparation
- Appointments and Positions
- Products:
  - Select from **My Bibliography** (preferred)
  - Use ORCID tab only if needed and reconcile back into My Bibliography later
  - Re-order products so your strongest evidence appears first

### Fill the NIH Supplement

- Personal Statement (3,500 chars, **no citations**)
- Contributions (≤5, 2,000 chars each, **no citations**)
- Honors (≤15)

**How to refer to evidence without citations:**  
Use language like “see Closely Related Product #1–#2” or “see Other Significant Product #3”.

## 2) Create CPOS in SciENcv

1. SciENcv → Create New Document
2. Format: NIH CPOS Common Form
3. Enter active + pending support and required in-kind resources

## 3) Certification (PI-only)

- Download PDF → Certify → Download
- Repeat for CPOS
- Do not edit the PDF after download (no printing/flattening)
