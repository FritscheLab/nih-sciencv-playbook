# What to include (practical guidance)

Treat CPOS as a **complete disclosure** record for research support and commitments. Institution policies vary; always confirm with your sponsored programs office.

Common categories teams struggle with:
- Consulting arrangements (if considered support/commitment by your institution)
- In-kind resources (e.g., lab space, equipment access, personnel support)
- Foreign appointments/affiliations that imply commitment
