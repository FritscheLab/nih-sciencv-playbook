# Administrator / Delegate quickstart

## Before you touch SciENcv

1. Ensure each PI/key person has:
   - eRA Commons ID
   - ORCID iD linked to eRA Commons and MyNCBI/SciENcv
2. Ask each PI to **add you as a delegate** in MyNCBI.
3. Confirm you have access to:
   - **SciENcv** delegation
   - **My Bibliography** delegation (needed to fix missing products/citations)

## Build the docs (delegate tasks)

- Create SciENcv biosketch and CPOS documents
- Import from ORCID (when clean) to reduce manual entry
- Curate products (10 total) and verify they align to narratives
- Paste narratives in **plain text**, re-check character counts
- Do a **PDF preview** for formatting/typos

## Hand-off to PI (required)

- Send the PI your “ready to certify” note
- PI logs in, **certifies**, downloads PDFs (or lets you download after)
