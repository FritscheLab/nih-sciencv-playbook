You’re on the proposal as senior/key personnel, so you must produce:

## Quick steps

1. ORCID iD: create (if needed)
2. Link ORCID to **eRA Commons** and **MyNCBI/SciENcv**
3. Ensure your **My Bibliography** is correct
4. Create the SciENcv documents (or work with your delegate)
5. **Certify + download PDFs**
