# Enforcement (warnings → errors)

NIH enforces Common Forms via **eRA system validations**:

- Initially: **warning** if the wrong/uncertified forms are used
- By **Feb 6, 2026**: warnings escalate to **errors** that prevent submission

This enforcement language is shown on NIH’s form directory pages (Biosketch Supplement, Biographical Sketch Common Form, and CPOS Common Form).

{: .warning }
> **Operational implication:** you need a dedicated **PI certification step** in your internal submission timeline. Delegates cannot certify for the PI.
