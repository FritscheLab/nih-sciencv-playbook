# What changed (old → new) — minimal but practical

**Key differences for authors:**

- **Biosketch becomes two parts:** Common Form + NIH Supplement
- **No citations inside narratives:** Personal Statement and Contributions have **no reference lists**; all citations live in **Products** (10 total).
- **Digital certification:** PDFs must be generated and certified in SciENcv.

**Key differences for admins:**

- You can help write and curate—but **PI must certify**.
- “Print to PDF” breaks machine-readable metadata and can trigger submission rejection.
