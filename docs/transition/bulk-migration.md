# Bulk migration (active awards + RPPR)

Even if an award started under the old biosketch format, RPPR/JIT submissions on/after Jan 25, 2026 will require Common Forms. Plan a department-wide conversion effort.

Tips:
- Start with the most active labs and frequent NIH submitters
- Create reusable narrative templates
- Standardize how you name SciENcv documents (PI_LASTNAME_MECH_YYYYMMDD)
