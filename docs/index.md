# NIH Common Forms (SciENcv) Playbook (2026)

This site is a **PI + admin team** guide to preparing NIH’s required **Common Forms** in **SciENcv**:

- **NIH Biosketch** = *Biographical Sketch Common Form* + *NIH Biographical Sketch Supplement*
- **Current and Pending (Other) Support** = *CPOS Common Form*

Independent guide, not official NIH/NCBI guidance. Verify details in [References]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link references.md %}).

{: .warning }
> **Effective date:** NIH requires Common Forms for **applications, JIT, RPPR, and Prior Approval submissions on/after Jan 25, 2026**. NIH enforces this through eRA validations (warnings at first; elevated to submission-blocking errors by Feb 6, 2026). See **Policy & Timeline**.

## Start here (role-based)

- [PI / faculty (15-minute checklist)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link quickstarts/pi.md %})
- [Administrator / delegate (fast checklist)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link quickstarts/admin-delegate.md %})
- [Co-I / key personnel (fast checklist)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link quickstarts/key-personnel.md %})

## The two biggest success factors

1. **Identity + data plumbing is correct** (ORCID ↔ eRA Commons ↔ MyNCBI/SciENcv; My Bibliography clean).
2. **Workflow timing** accounts for **PI-only certification** in SciENcv (delegates cannot certify).

## What’s inside

- A fast checklist for each role
- Step-by-step “how-to” pages for SciENcv biosketch and CPOS
- Templates (Personal Statement, Contributions, intake forms, email nudges)
- Troubleshooting and common eRA validation failures
- Curated references (NIH + institutional guides)
