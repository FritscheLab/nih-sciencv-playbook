# FAQ

## Can my admin certify for me?

No. Certification must be completed by the individual from their own SciENcv account.

## Can I edit the PDF after I download it?

Don’t. Any edit risks breaking the machine-readable metadata.

## Where do I put citations for my personal statement and contributions?

All citations live in **Products** (10 total). Use referential language in the narrative.
