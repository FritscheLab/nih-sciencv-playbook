# Common errors (and fixes)

## “Invalid form format” / form rejected

- Cause: PDF was printed/flattened
- Fix: re-download the original certified PDF from SciENcv

## “Missing persistent identifier”

- Cause: ORCID not linked correctly
- Fix: link ORCID in eRA Commons *and* MyNCBI/SciENcv

## “Certification required”

- Cause: PI did not certify
- Fix: PI must log in and certify (delegate cannot)

## Character limit exceeded

- Cause: hidden formatting from Word
- Fix: paste as plain text; re-check counts in SciENcv
