# Maintain & extend this guide

## Recommended operating model

- **One repo, one site**: all guidance in `docs/`
- Use **pull requests** for edits (even if just one maintainer) to preserve history
- Add updates to `Changelog`

## Adding your institution’s SOPs

- Add your local SOP links under:
  - `References`
  - Role-based quickstarts
  - Transition plan

## Screenshot policy

This repo includes **safe SVG placeholders**. Replace with screenshots that your institution is allowed to publish.
