# My Bibliography (Products engine)

SciENcv’s **Products** selector pulls citations primarily from **My Bibliography** (and may also show an **ORCID** tab if you’ve linked ORCID).

## What to do in My Bibliography

- Add missing publications (PubMed search is easiest when available)
- Add **non-traditional products** (patents, software, datasets, protocols) via manual entry or RIS upload
- Check PMCID status for NIH-funded papers (institutional policy may require this)
- If you have name variants, ensure papers are attributed correctly

## Selecting Products in SciENcv (practical tips)

- Prefer selecting from **My Bibliography** for consistency (and because it’s the NIH ecosystem of record).
- If you see an **ORCID** tab, it can help surface items not yet in My Bibliography—add them to My Bibliography when possible to keep one authoritative library.
- After selecting, **re-order** within each bucket so the strongest evidence is first.

> If an item isn’t in My Bibliography (or ORCID), it can’t be selected as a “Product” in SciENcv.
